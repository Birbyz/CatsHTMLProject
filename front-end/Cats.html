                          <i>Felis catus</i> has had a very long relationship with humans. Ancient Egyptians may have first domesticated cats as early as 4,000 years ago. 
                    Plentiful rodents probably drew wild felines to human communities. The cats' skill in killing them may have first earned the affectionate attention 
                    of humans<span id="dots">...</span> <br>
                    <br>
                    
                    <span id="more" style="display:none">
                              Early Egyptians worshipped a cat goddess and even mummified their beloved pets for their journey to the next world—accompanied by mummified 
                        mice! Cultures around the world later adopted cats as their own companions. Ancient Romans held a similar—albeit tempered and secularized—reverence for 
                        cats, which were seen as a symbol of liberty. In the Far East, cats were valued for the protection they offered treasured manuscripts from rodents.<br>
                        <br>                    
                              For some reason, however, cats came to be demonized in Europe during the Middle Ages. They were seen by many as being affiliated with witches and the devil,
                        and many were killed in an effort to ward off evil (an action that scholars think ironically helped to spread the plague, which was carried by rats). 
                        Not until the 1600s did the public image of cats begin to rally in the West.
